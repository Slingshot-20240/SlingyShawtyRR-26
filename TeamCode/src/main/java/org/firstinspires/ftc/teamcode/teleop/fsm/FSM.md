# FSM Ideas

## States (In progress ofc)
1. Start in base state, could be in two locations (by GOAL or bottom SCORING ZONE)
2. Ready to intake state (could just be base state depending on mechanisms)
3. Intaking state
4. Rotate Ball state (in order to get balls in correct scoring order) - TBD
5. Shooting state (should be able to fire balls quickly, rotating the turret as necessary depending on mechanisms)
6. Park state (depends on whether or not we do the extra 10 points thing)

## Automation (Ask Viktor & Arhaan)
1. One button to fire all 3 balls, little waits in between each ball, after done goes back to ready to intake
2. One button to scoring position? (not sure how we're going to set this poistion each time in tele - I need to
think about this more)

Mecanisms
- Intake
- Shooter with Hood
- Turret
- Transfer
